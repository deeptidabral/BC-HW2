The "To be or not to be" Soliloquy

HAMLET:
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

OPHELIA:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?

HAMLET:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.

HAMLET:
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

HAMLET:
Ha, ha! are you honest?

OPHELIA:
My lord?

HAMLET:
Are you fair?

OPHELIA:
What means your lordship?

HAMLET:
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

* 5. **Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶ *  
"Tulum is the ultimate escape, where everything feels like a dream. The beaches? Absolutely stunning ‚Äì soft, powdery white sand meeting crystal-clear turquoise waters. Every morning starts with the sound of waves and a big dose of sunshine. You can chill on the beach all day, but the real magic happens when you head to the cenotes. These natural sinkholes are something else ‚Äì picture crystal-clear water surrounded by lush jungle. Swimming in them is like stepping into a hidden world, cool and refreshing, with the sunlight cutting through the water like something out of a postcard. Cenote Dos Ojos is a favorite ‚Äì it‚Äôs like snorkeling in an underwater wonderland.

Back in Tulum, the vibe is just as amazing. Grab tacos stuffed with fresh fish or sip on a coconut straight from the tree. Exploring the ancient Mayan ruins perched on a cliff overlooking the sea is a must ‚Äì history with a view, can‚Äôt beat that! By night, Tulum turns into a boho dream, with fairy lights, beachside cocktails, and music that seems to blend perfectly with the sound of the waves. Whether it‚Äôs adventure, relaxation, or just soaking up the good vibes, Tulum and its cenotes are straight-up unforgettable. üå¥‚ú®"
